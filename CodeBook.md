Code Book for Mean Summary Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
===

The data produced here is a summarization of prior work described in detail here:

Full details of the original study can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


- before being grouped by subject and activity to calculate the mean of the values

- unless otherwise noted features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].


Column details
---

- Subject: identifier of the subject for which this data was collected (range 1-30)
- Activity: the activity performed during the measurement (one of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
